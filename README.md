# Linkclump

A Chrome extension that allows users to select multiple links by dragging a selection box and perform bulk actions (open tabs, copy URLs, bookmark).

## Repository Structure

This repository contains two versions of the Linkclump extension:

- **`original-extension/`** - Unchanged code from the original author (Manifest V2, does NOT support V3)
- **`simple-extension/`** - Minimal implementation focusing on core drag-to-select functionality

See each directory's README for specific installation and usage instructions.
